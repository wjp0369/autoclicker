# AutoClick by wjp0369

I play games. You play games. Sometimes, we all need an autoclicker. Type that into Google, and what do you see? A bunch of crap, trial-based, and frankly over-complicated programs to waste your time.
AutoClick doesn't do that. With AutoClick, you can change what you'll need. I made this because I was tired of jitter-clicking, and none of the autoclickers you can find online are worth it.

To download it, head on over to "Releases" on the right-side of the website. Click "AutoClick by wjp0369", then click "AutoClick.by.wjp0369.zip". Wait for it to download, extract the .zip file to a folder, read the README.txt, and use. 
Enjoy!
